This project is simple and fun game that allows you to catch baby yoda! He comes out of his crib and you have to try and catch him in order to recieve points. If you get ten or more points within the 30 swecond time frame you win! Otherwise you loose.
I decided to do this as my first project because I thought it was fun and creative. i love the mandalorian series so i drew my inspiration from that.

Check out my img folder to see the pictures I used!

Future development:
As a beginner I would love to come back to this game when I am more advanced and be able to make different levels (easy, medium, hard). The basic game is very fast right now to make it a little more fun to play. I would also love to add a visible timer so you can see how much time you have!

How to play the game:
Click on baby yoda and score points! Try to catch him!
